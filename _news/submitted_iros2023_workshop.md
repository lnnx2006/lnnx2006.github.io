We are happy to present our works [Real2Sim for Tissue Identification] and [SoftRobot Shape](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14039) at the IROS 2023 Workshop on Integrated Perception, Planning, and Control for Physically and Contextually-Aware Robot Autonomy. I'd love to meet you if you happen to be in Detroit!
