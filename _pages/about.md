I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Advanced Robotics and Controls Lab](https://www.ucsdarclab.com/) at University of California San Diego (UCSD). He is currently working on robotic autonomy for surgical applications, with semantic modeling, real-to-sim simulation, and advanced control techniques. Before that, he served as a research associate/postdoctoral scholar both at the Biorobotics Institute at Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna (SSSA), and the Center for Micro-BioRobotics at Italian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Italy. He finished his Ph.D. at Laboratory Amp`ere at INSA de Lyon, a
French grande  ́ecole and engineering university. He also worked as a senior control engineer and project director in a start-up company for the development of a robot for Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) surgery, right after his PhD dissertation. He has published a number of journal/conference papers.

Apart from my research habit, I enjoy hiking, backpacking and skiing.
