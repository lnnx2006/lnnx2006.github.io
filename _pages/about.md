I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Advanced Robotics and Controls Lab](https://www.ucsdarclab.com/) at University of California San Diego (UCSD), under the supervision of [Prof. Michael Yip](https://yip.eng.ucsd.edu/). I am currently working on robotic autonomy for surgical applications, with semantic modeling, real-to-sim simulation, and advanced control techniques. Before that, I served as a research associate/postdoctoral scholar both at the [Biorobotics Institute](https://www.santannapisa.it/en/institute/biorobotics) at Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna (SSSA), and the Center for [Bioinspired Soft Robotics](https://bsr.iit.it/) at Italian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Italy. I finished my Ph.D. at [Ampère Laboratory](http://www.ampere-lab.fr/?lang=en) at [INSA de Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/en/), a top French [Grande école](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_%C3%A9cole) and engineering university. Right after my PhD dissertation, I also worked for a start-up company [ROBO Medical Co., Ltd.](http://en.docrobo.com/) as a senior control engineer and project manager for the creation of a robot for endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) surgery. During the last few years, I have experiences in several robotic areas, including modeling, control, dynamics, planning, simulation, and optimization. I also have knowledge of sensor perception, signal processing, and computer vision. I have authored a number of journal and conference papers that have advanced and impacted on both the academic and industrial worlds. For more details, you can check out my [publications](/publications/) page or see my [full CV](/cv/) here.

Apart from my research habit, I enjoy hiking, backpacking and skiing.
