<p style="font-family:courier;color:#E96357">I am on the job market and looking for a faculty position starting from 2024 or later.</p>

I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Advanced Robotics and Controls Lab](https://www.ucsdarclab.com/) at the University of California San Diego, mentored by [Prof. Michael Yip](https://yip.eng.ucsd.edu/). Before this role, I conducted research at the [Biorobotics Institute](https://www.santannapisa.it/en/institute/biorobotics) with [Prof. Filippo Cavallo](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=4qiWy0MAAAAJ&hl=en) and at the Center for [Bioinspired Soft Robotics](https://bsr.iit.it/) at the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT), Italy. My Ph.D. was completed at INSA de Lyon, a top ranked French engineering university, under the guidance of [Prof. Arnaud Lelev√©](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=ViL8uI8AAAAJ&hl=fr). I also have experience as a senior control engineer and project manager at [ROBO Medical Co., Ltd.](http://en.docrobo.com/), a startup specializing in creating robots for endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) surgery.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **robotics, autonomous systems, control theory**, encompassing computational modeling, advanced control, AI, and integrated hardware/software for robotic autonomy. I focus on applying these in unstructured environments, including biomedical, healthcare, manufacturing, industrial, and aerospace settings.
