<!-- I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Advanced Robotics and Controls Lab](https://www.ucsdarclab.com/) at the University of California San Diego (UCSD), under the supervision of [Prof. Michael Yip](https://yip.eng.ucsd.edu/). I am currently working on robotic autonomy for surgical applications, with semantic modeling, real-to-sim simulation, and advanced control techniques. Before that, I served as a research associate and postdoctoral scholar both at the [Biorobotics Institute](https://www.santannapisa.it/en/institute/biorobotics) with [Prof. Filippo Cavallo](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=4qiWy0MAAAAJ&hl=en) at Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna (SSSA), and the Center for [Bioinspired Soft Robotics](https://bsr.iit.it/) at Italian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Italy. I finished my Ph.D. at [Ampère Laboratory](http://www.ampere-lab.fr/?lang=en) with [Prof. Arnaud Lelevé](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=ViL8uI8AAAAJ&hl=fr)  at [INSA de Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/en/), a top French [Grande école](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_%C3%A9cole) and engineering university. Right after my Ph.D. dissertation, I also worked for a start-up company [ROBO Medical Co., Ltd.](http://en.docrobo.com/) as a senior control engineer and project manager for the creation of a robot for endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) surgery. During the last few years, I have experience in several robotic areas, including modeling, control, dynamics, planning, simulation, and optimization. I also have knowledge of sensor perception, signal processing, and computer vision. I have authored a number of journal and conference papers that have advanced and impacted both the academic and industrial worlds. For more details, you can check out my [publications](/publications/) page or see my [full CV](/cv/) here. -->

<p style="font-family:courier;color:#E96357">I am on the job market and looking for a faculty position starting from Fall 2023.</p>

I am a postdoctoral researcher currently affiliated with the [Advanced Robotics and Controls Lab](https://www.ucsdarclab.com/) at the University of California San Diego, under the mentorship of [Prof. Michael Yip](https://yip.eng.ucsd.edu/). My current research focuses on the development of robotic autonomy for surgical applications, with a specific emphasis on semantic modeling, real-to-sim simulation, and advanced control techniques.

Prior to this, I held research positions at the [Biorobotics Institute](https://www.santannapisa.it/en/institute/biorobotics) with [Prof. Filippo Cavallo](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=4qiWy0MAAAAJ&hl=en) and the Center for [Bioinspired Soft Robotics](https://bsr.iit.it/) at Italian Institute of Technology (IIT), Italy. I completed my Ph.D. at INSA de Lyon, a prestigious French engineering university, under the supervision of [Prof. Arnaud Lelevé](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=ViL8uI8AAAAJ&hl=fr).

In addition, I have worked as a senior control engineer and project manager for [ROBO Medical Co., Ltd.](http://en.docrobo.com/), a start-up company specializing in the creation of robots for endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) surgery.

My research interests span several areas, including modeling, control, dynamics, planning, simulation, and optimization, as well as sensor perception, signal processing, and computer vision. I have published numerous papers in high-impact journals and conferences, and my research has made significant contributions to both academia and industry.

For further information about my background and research contributions, please refer to my [publications](/publications/) page or my comprehensive [CV](/cv/).

Apart from my research habit, I enjoy hiking, backpacking and skiing.
