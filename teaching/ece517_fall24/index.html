        <h2>Course Description</h2>
        <p>This course offers a comprehensive introduction to reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning where
          agents learn to make decisions by interacting with their environment. Students will explore core concepts such
          as Markov Decision Processes, value functions, and policy optimization.
          <!-- The course will cover key algorithms including Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and policy gradient methods. -->
          Through hands-on projects, students will apply these techniques to solve complex problems in areas like
          robotics, game AI, and autonomous systems.
          By the end of the course, participants will have a solid understanding of how to build and implement
          reinforcement learning models in real-world scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>The students are expected to sign up on <a href="https://utk.instructure.com/courses/203539">Canvas</a>.</p>

        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>The students are expected to have background in linear system theory, probability theory, and optimization
          theory, as well as a strong programming background.</p>

        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <p>Grading will be based on the following rubric.</p>
        <table id="rubric-tab">
          <tr class="r1">
            <td class="c1"><b>Class Participation </b> </td>
            <td class="c2"> <b>5%</b> </td>
          </tr>
          <tr class="r1">
            <td class="c1"><b>Assignments (4*5%)</b> </td>
            <td class="c2"> <b>20%</b> </td>
          </tr>
          <tr class="r2">
            <td class="c1"><b>Project 1 (with report)</b> </td>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><b>Participation (5%; ongoing).</b> Participation points can be earned by actively engaging in discussions
        during class and on Canvas.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Assignments (20%).</b> There will be approximately 4 written assignments throughout the semester. Students
        are expected to complete all assigned problems individually.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Projects (75%).</b> There will be 2 mini-projects + 1 final project. These projects will usually be due two
        weeks after the description is handed out. The final project will be a project of your choice and will include a
        presentation. All the project include reports and programming assignments. The first 2 mini-projects are
        individual while final projects should be done in groups unless given permission otherwise. Therefore, you might
        want to find a partner sooner than later.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><br />
    Late Submission Policy: All deadlines are firm unless notified in advance. Late submissions can only be accepted
    within next 24hr of the deadline but will result in a straight 25% off of grade.</p>

  <!-- <h2>Collaboration and Academic Integrity</h2>
  <p>Integrity of scholarship is essential for an academic community. To protect the validity of intellectual work both
    faculty and students must honor this principle. For students, this means that all academic work will be done by the
    individual to whom it is assigned, without unauthorized aid of any kind. It is dishonest to cheat on exams, copy
    other people's work, or fake experimental results. Cheating, plagiarism and any other form of academic dishonesty
    will not be tolerated. An important element of academic integrity is also fully and correctly acknowledging any
    materials taken from the work of others. Never claim work or ideas to be yours if they are not, and never aid others
    in cheating, e.g., by offering them your solutions. Do not upload solutions or assignments online, even after you
    have finished the course. You are encouraged to discuss the assignments with other students but please note that all
    assignments in this course are individual and the work you turn in should be entirely your own! Use of other
    students&rsquo; course work, in part or in total, to develop, complete or correct course work is unauthorized. Each
    student is responsible for knowing and abiding by <a href="https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/">UCSD's Code of
      Academic Integrity</a>. Instances of academic dishonesty will be penalized by grade reduction at the instructor's
    discretion and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for adjudication. Committing acts that violate
    Student Conduct policies are cause for suspension or dismissal from UCSD.</p> -->
