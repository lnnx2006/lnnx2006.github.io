        <h2>Course Description</h2>
        <p>Robots operate in uncertain, dynamic environments by sensing through noisy sensors, acting through imperfect
          actuators, and improving performance through experience. This course covers the fundamental principles
          underlying robot perception, planning, control, and learning. Topics span probabilistic state estimation,
          optimal control and planning, and modern reinforcement learning methods. The course emphasizes both
          theoretical foundations and hands-on implementation for robotic systems.
        </p>
        <p>The students are expected to sign up on <a href="https://utk.instructure.com/">Canvas</a>.</p>

        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>The students are expected to have background in linear system theory, probability theory, and optimization
          theory, as well as a strong programming background.</p>

        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <p>Grading will be based on the following rubric.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><b>Participation (10%).</b> Participation points can be earned by attending class, actively engaging in
        discussions during class and on Canvas.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Project (70%).</b> There will be 4 coding projects throughout the semester. Students
        are expected to complete all projects individually.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Paper Reading & Presentation (70%).</b> Each student are expected to read a paper related to the course, and
        deliver a in-class <strong>10min presentation + 5min Q&A</strong> for the paper.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><br />
    <strong>Late Submission Policy:</strong> All deadlines are firm unless notified in advance. Late submissions can
    only be accepted within next 24hr of the deadline but will result in a straight 25% off of grade.

  <!-- <h2>Collaboration and Academic Integrity</h2>
  <p>Integrity of scholarship is essential for an academic community. To protect the validity of intellectual work both
    faculty and students must honor this principle. For students, this means that all academic work will be done by the
    individual to whom it is assigned, without unauthorized aid of any kind. It is dishonest to cheat on exams, copy
    other people's work, or fake experimental results. Cheating, plagiarism and any other form of academic dishonesty
    will not be tolerated. An important element of academic integrity is also fully and correctly acknowledging any
    materials taken from the work of others. Never claim work or ideas to be yours if they are not, and never aid others
    in cheating, e.g., by offering them your solutions. Do not upload solutions or assignments online, even after you
    have finished the course. You are encouraged to discuss the assignments with other students but please note that all
    assignments in this course are individual and the work you turn in should be entirely your own! Use of other
    students&rsquo; course work, in part or in total, to develop, complete or correct course work is unauthorized. Each
    student is responsible for knowing and abiding by <a href="https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/">UCSD's Code of
      Academic Integrity</a>. Instances of academic dishonesty will be penalized by grade reduction at the instructor's
    discretion and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for adjudication. Committing acts that violate
    Student Conduct policies are cause for suspension or dismissal from UCSD.</p> -->
