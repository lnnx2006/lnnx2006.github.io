    title    = {On the time dependence of holographic complexity for charged AdS black holes with scalar hair},
    abstract = {In the presence of a scalar hair perturbation, the Cauchy horizon of a Reissner-Nordström black hole disappears and is replaced by the rapid collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge, which leads to a Kasner singularity. We study the time dependence of holographic complexity, both for the volume and for the action proposals, in a class of models with hairy black holes. Volume complexity can only probe a portion of the black hole interior that remains far away from the Kasner singularity. We provide numerical evidence that the Lloyd bound is satisfied by the volume complexity rate in all the parameter space. Action complexity can instead probe a portion of the spacetime closer to the singularity. In particular, the complexity rate diverges at the critical time t_c for which the Wheeler-DeWitt patch touches the singularity. After the critical time the action complexity rate approaches a constant. We find that the Kasner exponent does not directly affect the details of the divergence of the complexity rate at t=t_c and the late-time behaviour of the complexity. The Lloyd bound is violated by action complexity at finite time, because the complexity rate diverges at t=t_c. We find that the Lloyd bound is satisfied by the asymptotic action complexity rate in all the parameter space that we explored.},

    title    = {Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz past turning points: the (elliptic) sinh-Gordon model},
    abstract = {We analyze the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) for various integrable S-matrices in the context of generalized TTbar deformations. We focus on the sinh-Gordon model and its elliptic deformation in both its fermionic and bosonic realizations. We confirm that the determining factor for a turning point in the TBA, interpreted as a finite Hagedorn temperature, is the difference between the number of bound states and resonances in the theory. Implementing the numerical pseudo-arclength continuation method, we are able to follow the solutions to the TBA equations past the turning point all the way to the ultraviolet regime. We find that for any number k of resonances the pair of complex conjugate solutions below the turning point is such that the effective central charge is minimized. As k → ∞ the UV effective central charge goes to zero as in the elliptic sinh-Gordon model. Finally we uncover a new family of UV complete integrable theories defined by the bosonic counterparts of the S-matrices describing the Φ(1,3) integrable deformation of non-unitary minimal models M(2,2n+3).},

    title    = {Phases Of Melonic Quantum Mechanics},
    abstract = {We explore in detail the properties of two melonic quantum mechanical theories which can be formulated either as fermionic matrix quantum mechanics in the new large D limit, or as disordered models. Both models have a mass parameter m and the transition from the perturbative large m region to the strongly coupled "black-hole" small m region is associated with several interesting phenomena. One model, with U(n)^2 symmetry and equivalent to complex SYK, has a line of first-order phase transitions terminating, for a strictly positive temperature, at a critical point having non-trivial, non-mean-field critical exponents for standard thermodynamical quantities. Quasi-normal frequencies, as well as Lyapunov exponents associated with out-of-time-ordered four-point functions, are also singular at the critical point, leading to interesting new critical exponents. The other model, with reduced U(n) symmetry, has a quantum critical point at strictly zero temperature and positive critical mass m∗. For 0 < m < m∗, it flows to a new gapless IR fixed point, for which the standard scale invariance is spontaneously broken by the appearance of distinct scaling dimensions ∆+ and ∆− for the Euclidean two-point function when t → +∞ and t → −∞ respectively. We provide several detailed and pedagogical derivations, including rigorous proofs or simplified arguments for some results that were already known in the literature.},

The Schwinger-Dyson equations can have two solutions describing either a high entropy, SYK black-hole-like phase, or a low entropy one with trivial IR behavior. In the strongly coupled region of the mass-temperature plane, there is a line of first order phase transitions between the high and low entropy phases. This line terminates at a new critical point which we study numerically in detail. The critical exponents are nonmean field and differ on the two sides of the transition. We also study purely bosonic unstable and stable melonic models. The former has a line of Kazakov critical points beyond which the Schwinger-Dyson equations do not have a consistent solution. Moreover, in both models the would-be SYK-like solution of the IR limit of the equations does not exist in the full theory.},

We find the holographic D3-brane description for Wilson loops with internal cusps in two different limits: small cusp angle and k λ^½ ≫ N. This allows for a non-trivial check of a conjectured relation between the Bremsstrahlung function and the expectation value of the ½ BPS circular loop in the case of a representation other than the fundamental. Moreover, we observe that in the limit of k ≫ N, the cusped Wilson line expectation value is simply given by the exponential of the 1-loop diagram. Using group theory arguments, this eikonal exponentiation is conjectured to take place for all Wilson loop operators in symmetric representations with large k, independently of the contour on which they are supported.},
