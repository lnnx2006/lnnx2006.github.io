  abstract={Autonomous robotic surgery has seen significant progression over the last decade with the aims of reducing surgeon fatigue, improving procedural consistency, and perhaps one day take over surgery itself. However, automation has not been applied to the critical surgical task of controlling tissue and blood vessel bleeding-known as hemostasis. The task of hemostasis covers a spectrum of bleeding sources and a range of blood velocity, trajectory, and volume. In an extreme case, an un-controlled blood vessel fills the surgical field with flowing blood. In this work, we present the first, automated solution for hemostasis through development of a novel probabilistic blood flow detection algorithm and a trajectory generation technique that guides autonomous suction tools towards pooling blood. The blood flow detection algorithm is tested in both simulated scenes and in a real-life trauma scenario involving a hemorrhage that occurred during thyroidectomy. The complete solution is tested in a physical lab setting with the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) and a simulated surgical cavity for blood to flow through. The results show that our automated solution has accurate detection, a fast reaction time, and effective removal of the flowing blood. Therefore, the proposed methods are powerful tools to clearing the surgical field which can be followed by either a surgeon or future robotic automation developments to close the vessel rupture.},

  abstract={More particularly in the medical field, gesture quality is primordial. Professionals have to follow hands-on trainings to acquire a sufficient level of skills in the call of duty. For a decade, computer based simulators have helped the learners in numerous learnings, but these simulations still have to be associated with hands-on trainings on manikins, animals or cadavers, even if they do not always provide a sufficient level of realism and they are costly in the long term. Therefore, their training period has to finish on real patients, which is risky. Haptic simulators (furnishing an effort feeling) are becoming a more appropriated solution as they can reproduce realist efforts applied by organs onto the tools and they can provide countless prerecorded use cases. However, learning alone on a simulator is not always efficient compared to a fellowship training (or supervised training) where the instructor and the trainee manipulate together the same tools. Thus, this study introduces an haptic system for supervised hands-on training: the instructor and the trainee interoperate through their own haptic interface. They collaborate either with a real tool dived into a real environment (the tool is handled by a robotic arm), or with a virtual tool/environment. An energetic approach, using in particular the port-Hamiltonian modelling, has been used to ensure the stability and the robustness of the system. This system has been designed and validated experimentally on a one degree of freedom haptic interface. A comparative study with two other dual-user haptic systems (in simulation) showed the interest of this new architecture for hands-on training. In order to use this system when both users are away from each other, this study proposes some enhancements to cope with constant communication time delays, but they are not optimized yet.},

  abstract={Simulation modeling of robots, objects, and environments is the backbone for all model-based control and learning. It is leveraged broadly across dynamic programming and model-predictive control, as well as data generation for imitation, transfer, and reinforcement learning. In addition to fidelity, key features of models in these control and learning contexts are speed, stability, and native differentiability. However, many popular simulation platforms for robotics today lack at least one of the features above. More recently, position-based dynamics (PBD) has become a very popular simulation tool for modeling complex scenes of rigid and non-rigid object interactions, due to its speed and stability, and is starting to gain significant interest in robotics for its potential use in model-based control and learning. Thus, in this paper, we present a mathematical formulation for coupling position-based dynamics (PBD) simulation and optimal robot design, model-based motion control and system identification. Our framework breaks down PBD definitions and derivations for various types of joint-based articulated rigid bodies. We present a back-propagation method with automatic differentiation, which can integrate both positional and angular geometric constraints. Our framework can critically provide the native gradient information and perform gradient-based optimization tasks. We also propose articulated joint model representations and simulation workflow for our differentiable framework. We demonstrate the capability of the framework in efficient optimal robot design, accurate trajectory torque estimation and supporting spring stiffness estimation, where we achieve minor errors. We also implement impedance control in real robots to demonstrate the potential of our differentiable framework in human-in-the-loop applications.},

  ABSTRACT={Robot manipulation of rope-like objects is an interesting problem that has some critical applications, such as autonomous robotic suturing. Solving for and controlling rope is difficult due to the complexity of rope physics and the challenge of building fast and accurate models of deformable materials. While more data-driven approaches have become more popular for finding controllers that learn to do a single task, there is still a strong motivation for a model-based method that could be used to solve a large variety of optimization problems. Towards this end, we introduced compliant, position-based dynamics (XPBD) to model rope-like objects. Using geometric constraints, the model can represent the coupling of shear/stretch and bend/twist effects. Of crucial importance is that our formulation is differentiable, which can solve parameter estimation problems and improve the matching of rope physics to real-life scenarios (i.e., the real-to-sim problem). For the generality of rope-like objects, two different solvers are proposed to handle the inextensible and extensible effects of varied material stiffness for the rope. We demonstrate our framework's robustness and accuracy on real-to-sim experimental setups using the Baxter robot and the da Vinci research kit (DVRK). Our work leads to a new path for robotic manipulation of the deformable rope-like object taking advantage of the ready-to-use gradients.},
